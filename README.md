# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge, I building an interactive dashboard using Leaflet library and visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). I created a map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude on a map. The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. In addition, I include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake and its associated marker when it is clicked. Lastly, I added a legend that provides context for the map data.
